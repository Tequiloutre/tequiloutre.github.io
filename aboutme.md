# Hi !

My name is Youen Corbel and I'm a 22yo  
:fr: programmer.

I was born in Brest in Britanny and mostly lived in this region.

I play video games since I was a child and almost always wanted to make some myself.

I first studied IT to learn many things about computers in general and then learned Gameplay Programming at Objectif 3D in Montpellier.

Today, I'm searching for a great studio to start my career !
