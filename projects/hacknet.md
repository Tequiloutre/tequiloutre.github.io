## Resume
Hacknet is a hacking simulation game where the player uses a terminal and types commands to access computers and servers.

The idea here was to recreate only the terminal system of the game in C++.  
This means :
- Input commands
- Interpret commands to do something
- Node & Network system
- Filesystems (files & folders)
